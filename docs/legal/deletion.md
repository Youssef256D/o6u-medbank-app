# Data Deletion Instructions

Effective date: June 30, 2026

This page explains how to request deletion of your MedBank account data and how
to remove local data stored in your browser.

## Request account deletion

To request deletion of your MedBank account, use the MedBank Contact or Support
page and include:

- the email address connected to your MedBank account;
- your full name as it appears in MedBank, if available;
- a clear request such as "Please delete my MedBank account";
- whether you also want support messages connected to the request deleted after
  the request is handled, where feasible.

If you cannot access your account, send the request using the same email address
you used to register. MedBank may ask for additional verification before acting
on a deletion request.

## What account deletion usually removes

Account deletion generally removes or disconnects:

- your Supabase Auth account;
- your MedBank profile and account-access state;
- your course enrollments and enrollment requests;
- your test blocks, responses, notes, flags, analytics, and review queues where
  they are tied only to your account;
- your user-scoped app-state records and pending sync records;
- your notification read state and user-specific course progress where feasible.

Some records may be retained, anonymized, or disconnected from your account when
needed for security, audit integrity, course administration, abuse prevention,
legal obligations, backup integrity, or to avoid corrupting shared course and
question-bank data.

## What account deletion does not remove

Account deletion does not automatically remove shared course content, question
banks, explanations, announcements, imported materials, or admin-created
records that are not personal to your account.

If you were an administrator or content editor, changes you made to shared
course or question-bank content may remain so the course remains usable for
other students. Audit logs may retain limited information about administrative
actions when needed for security and accountability.

## Previous-test retention

Previous-test history is automatically retained for 20 days. Older previous-test
entries are deleted from hosted history and matching session backup payloads.
Support cannot restore previous-test history after it has been pruned by this
retention process.

## Remove local browser data

You can remove local MedBank data from your browser without deleting your hosted
account:

1. Sign out of MedBank.
2. Open your browser's site settings for the MedBank domain.
3. Clear site data, local storage, cache, and service-worker data for MedBank.
4. Reload MedBank and sign in again if you want to continue using the service.

Clearing local browser data may remove theme preferences, route memory,
offline/pending writes, and cached study data on that device. It does not delete
hosted Supabase account data by itself.

## Course access removal

If you only want to leave a course or remove access to a course bank, contact
support or the relevant administrator. Course-access removal is different from
full account deletion.

## Support and verification

Deletion requests are reviewed through support. MedBank may refuse, delay,
limit, or ask for more information about a request when needed to verify
ownership, protect another user's data, preserve security logs, comply with
administrative requirements, or prevent abuse.
